# Smart Travel Suggestion System

## Overview
The Smart Travel Suggestion System is a machine learning–based application that recommends travel destinations based on user preferences.  
It helps users plan trips easily by providing smart and personalized suggestions.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to simplify travel planning by using machine learning to suggest suitable travel destinations based on user inputs.

## How the System Works
Users provide inputs such as budget, travel type, season, and interests.  
The system processes this data using a **Random Forest machine learning algorithm**.  
Based on the analysis, it recommends the most suitable travel destinations.

## Machine Learning Algorithm
- Algorithm Used: **Random Forest**
- Purpose: To make accurate travel recommendations
- Advantage: Handles multiple inputs efficiently and provides better accuracy

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Machine Learning  
- Random Forest Algorithm  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Flask (for backend)  
- HTML & CSS (for frontend)

## Features
- Personalized travel suggestions  
- Fast and accurate results  
- Easy-to-use interface  
- Data-driven recommendations
